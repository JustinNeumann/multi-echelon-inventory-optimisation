# Implementation of multi-echelon guaranteed-service model (GSM)

Thsi model implements the paper "A tutorial to set safety stock under guaranteed-service time by dynamic programming" from Luis A. Moncayo-Martinez and Adan Ramirez-LÃ³pez (2016).

I'm not sure if the implementation is a 100% bug free and am happy for improvement suggestions, also in terms of execution speed.

The calculated values in the model are not rounded.
